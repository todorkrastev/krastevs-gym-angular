# Krastev's Gym Angular

## Description

Krastev's Gym Angular is a web application designed to manage gym-related activities and services. Developed with Angular, it utilizes AngularFire for Firebase integration, Angular Material for UI, Cloud Firestore for real-time data storage, and RxJS for reactive programming. This project highlights my skills in using modern web technologies to create efficient and responsive applications.
